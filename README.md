Test strategies:
- this repo contains UI snapshot tests (with click/hover/drag events covered), unit tests and integration tests written using Jest. There could be written more and more tests for each module for better coverage.
- Also for more accurate UI tests we can use such tools as Selenium or Puppeteer.
- All implemented test strategies are easy to run during CI/CD (just run npm script)
